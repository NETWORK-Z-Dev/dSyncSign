# dSyncSign

dSyncSign is an additional package that comes with a few helper functions that can enhance the plain dSync package. dSyncSign comes with the following features:

- Creation of a private key file and public key
- Ability to sign strings or json objects, or even nested objects inside a json object
- Ability to verify signed strings/objects using a known public key
- Ability to encrypt and decrypt data with a private key or password

Folders like `/js` are meant to show the current available implementations, meaning as of right now dSyncSign is only available in JavaScript/NodeJS.
